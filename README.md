# Hi, I’m Justus Haataja 👋

I’m a **software engineering student** focused on **full-stack web development** and continuous learning. I build practical, end-to-end applications where frontend usability, backend reliability, and clean architecture all matter.

My goal is simple: **write maintainable software that solves real problems** and keep improving with every project.

## 🧩 Full-Stack Development
I design and implement complete web applications, from UI to database.

**What I focus on:**
- Clean, responsive, and accessible frontend interfaces
- Well-structured backend APIs and data models
- Clear separation of concerns and maintainable codebases
- Turning requirements into working, production-ready solutions

**Typical stack:**
- Frontend: React, TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- Backend: Python (FastAPI), REST APIs
- Databases: SQL (PostgreSQL, SQLite)
- Tooling: Docker, Git, Vite, modern build tools

---

## 📈 Continuous Learning Mindset
I actively improve my skills by:
- Building projects from scratch (not just tutorials)
- Refactoring and revisiting older code to improve quality
- Exploring new tools, patterns, and best practices
- Studying topics like data handling, system design, and security fundamentals

I care about **why** things work, not just how to make them run.

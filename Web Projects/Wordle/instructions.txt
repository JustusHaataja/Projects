Installation and Setup

To set up the project and run the game locally, follow these steps:

1. Install Node.js and npm

Make sure you have Node.js installed. npm (Node Package Manager) comes with Node.js.

Check if npm is installed:

If npm is not installed, install it by downloading Node.js from the official website.

2. Initialize the project

Run the following command in your project folder to create a package.json file:

npm init -y

Lite-server is a lightweight development server for running the project.

npm install --save-dev lite-server

4. Update package.json

Modify the scripts section in package.json to include a start command:

"scripts": {
  "start": "lite-server"

tsc filename.ts

To watch for changes and recompile automatically:

tsc filename.ts --watch

6. Start the Development Server

Run the following command to start the server and open the game in the browser:
